<b>Morse Codez</b> will help you to learn the individual letters, numbers, punctuation, and prosigns.
  It is meant as a "helper" application when you are initially learning morse code, by allowing you
  to play the code for any character, so that you can learn it by sound, without having to look
  at anything printed.

  There may eventually be more here, but for now, click the "Single Characters" menu item above
